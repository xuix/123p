        <h2>Welcome to the High Level Parking Co</h2><br>
        At a time when parking rates are going through the roof, we are proud to offer an unbeatable deal for your long term car parking at only £70 per month at the High Level Bridge in Newcastle / Gateshead; or £30 per month for the car park at Bondgate in Bishop Auckland.

The Newcastle / Gateshead car park at the High Level Bridge offers ideal long term but cost effective parking for those working in or regularly visiting Newcastle upon Tyne's City Centre, The Sage, Gateshead Hilton Hotel, The Baltic, Newcastle Quayside, Law Courts, Central Station, Bigg Market, Eldon Square and surrounding shopping areas including Dean Street, Grey Street and Northumberland Street - as well as match-day parking at St James Park (Sports Direct Arena) and for the Olympic events.

<h2>Newcastle's premier secure long stay Car Park for the City Center, Central Station and Quayside.</h2><br>

At a time when parking fees in Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead are going through the roof, and availability is becoming scarce, we are proud to offer an unbeatable deal of only £70 per month for the High Level Car Park at Newcastle / Gateshead. There is no requirement to pay months in advance for parking or constantly needing to have coinage for meters or popping out to “top-up”.

You only subscribe for 1 month at a time at £70 - it's as easy as that !

All monthly subscriptions are paid by standing order on the 1st day of each month which you can set up yourself if you have internet banking.

There is a small one-off introductory deposit of £20 for the security key/badge when you join (fully refundable on return when you leave).

The secure car park offers an ideal parking facility for those working in or regularly visiting Newcastle upon Tyne's City Centre, The Sage, Gateshead Hilton Hotel, The Baltic, Newcastle Quayside, Law Courts, Central Station, Bigg Market, Eldon Square and surrounding shopping areas including Dean Street, Grey Street and Northumberland Street - as well as match-day parking at St James Park (Sports Direct Arena) and for the Olympic events.

It also provides a convenient cost effective alternative to the Newcastle Airport car park where even advanced parking rates are almost £160 per month for long stay and £227 for medium stay.

Why pay upwards of 60p per hour to park on a busy street – having queued in the traffic to find a space ? Why risk Parking Fines because you have no change or have exceeded your time at the meter ?

High Level Bridge Car Park offers long term, cost-effective car parking 24 hours a day; 7 days a week (equivalent to only £2.33 per day) to those working around or visiting the City Centre - and you have the added advantage of being able to leave your car overnight or whilst weekend shopping.

And now in its 20th year in operation – Newcastle’s High Level Bridge Car Park remains as popular as ever !

          unbeatable deal for your long term car parking at only £70 per month <br> <br> The short pleasant walk across the River is less than 5 minutes to Newcastle Cathedral, and that the walk across the High Level Bridge benefits from under cover pavement all the way across. Whatever the weather, you can keep dry, and there are no hills to climb: unlike from the quayside !

          The High Level Bridge was re-opened to pedestrians in May 2008 following extensive improvements and renovations costing over £42 million. Built originally in 1849 by the legendary Robert Stephenson, the bridge is now registered as a fabulous Grade 1 Historic Listed Structure.
          
          You can enjoy this iconic British engineering structure from the Victorian days.

                    Should you wish to use another car, say on the weekend for shopping in Newcastle, all you need do is display your own membership badge on the dashboard in the same way as with your own car. Each time you park, just ensure your membership badge which we issue to you is clearly displayed on the dash. Thus you can use your partner’s car whenever you wish for that last minute shopping in town !
          
          Couldn’t be simpler!

Turn immediately left again up Half Moon lane – where the car park faces you.

        For those coming off the main A167 (Tyne Bridge road) – you need to turn west at the first exit immediately on the south of the Tyne Bridge (signed “A1 / A184”). At the first traffic lights (100m on) – turn right into Wellington Street and immediate left into Half Moon Lane.
